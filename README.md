# STQD6324_DataManagement_Assignment3
## Classification Model using PySpark with Iris Dataset
### Project Objective:
To perform classification models (**Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression**) on Iris dataset by leveraging PySpark MLlib library.
### About Iris Dataset:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples (flowers), each with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).<br>
The target variable (y) has three classes: 0 for setosa, 1 for versicolor, and 2 for virginica.<br>
The Iris dataset is often used as a starting point for learning and practicing various machine learning algorithms and techniques due to its simplicity and clarity.<br>

### Setup Guide:
For this project, we will setup Spark in local machine where it will run in local process, utilizing only a single JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on the local machine.<br>
In windows:
1. Install Java
3. Install Apache Spark
4. Install winutils.exe<br>

In conda environment (since we will use Jupyter Notebook to run PySpark):
1. Install PySpark in conda environment
2. Install FindSpark in conda environment
