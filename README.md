## Classification Model using PySpark with Iris Dataset
### About Iris Dataset:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples (flowers), each with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).<br>
The target variable (y) has three classes: 0 for setosa, 1 for versicolor, and 2 for virginica.<br>
The Iris dataset is often used as a starting point for learning and practicing various machine learning algorithms and techniques due to its simplicity and clarity.<br>
